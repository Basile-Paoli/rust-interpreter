# Interpreter

## Description

This is a project that aims to create an intepreter written in Rust.

This project follows a previous interpreter I built as a school projet in C, which can be
found [here](https://www.github.com/Basile-Paoli/Langaje).

This is my first project in Rust, so it is mainly a learning project, but the goal is to improve on the previous project
which included the following features:

- Primitives types: int, float, string
- Arrays
- Functions
- Control structures: if, while, for

Ideally, I would like to add user defined types, in a way similar to structs in C/go.

I chose Rust because the previous project suffered from a lot of memory leaks, and issues with references, especially
when it came to arrays and string. Rust's ownership system should force me to work on these issues.
